Alternative to [BQN's standard AutoHotkey based system-wide input for Windows](https://mlochbaum.github.io/BQN/editors/index.html#windows).  Based on [Hotstrings](https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/Hotstrings.htm) instead of `RAlt` hotkeys to avoid conflicts with existing hotkeys.

<kbd>F12</kbd> to toggle.

Some sample expansions:
- `\x` → `𝕩`
- `\X` → `𝕏`
- `\z` → `⥊`
- `\Z` → `⋈`
- `\;` → `⋄`
- `\:` → `·`
